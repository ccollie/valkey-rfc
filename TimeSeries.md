# ValkeyTimeSeries Module RFC

## Abstract

The proposed feature is ValkeyTimeSeries which is a Rust based Module that brings a native time series data type to Valkey.

## Motivation
Support for a time series data type in Valkey is essential for developers who need to store and query time series data. 
Redis Ltd.â€˜s TimeSeries module is published under a proprietary license, hence cannot be distributed freely with ValKey.

We propose a Rust based implementation to allows for better memory management, performance and safety.

## Design Considerations

The ValkeyTimeSeries module brings a time series module data type to Valkey and provides commands to create 
time series, operate on them (add sample, query, perform aggregations, compactions, downsampling and joins, etc).
It allows customization of properties of each series (compression, retention, compactions, etc) through commands and 
configurations. It also allows users to back up & restore time series 
(through RDB load and save).

-- todo: discuss use of threads for parallelism and background tasks (series and index compaction, index maintenance, etc)
-- efficient memory management (interning for labels, ART, which allows for prefix compression, Roaring Bitmaps to store series ids)
-- efficient filtering and indexing

When a user adds a sample (e.g. TS.ADD) to the series, the item is either appended to the last chunk, or upserted into a prior chunk 
(out-of-order inserts are allowed). 

We have the following terminologies / properties:
* TimeSeries Object: The top level structure representing the data type. It contains meta data and a list of lower-level
                chunks containing the actual sample data.
* Sample: A tuple of timestamp and value.
* Chunk: A container for samples. Chunks have configurable size and encoding policies.

### Enhancements over RedisTimeSeries
* Joins: ValkeyTimeSeries will support joins between time series objects, including INNER, OUTER and ASOF joins
* Filtering: support filtering using Prometheus style selectors
* Metadata: support for returning metadata on time series objects (label names, label values, cardinality, etc)
* Rounding: support for rounding sample values to a specified precision. This is enforced for all samples in a time series.
* Developer Ergonomics: support for relative timestamps in queries, e.g. `TS.RANGE key -6hrs -3hrs` , unit suffixes (e.g. `1s`, `3mb`, `20K`), etc.

### Module OnLoad

Upon loading, the module registers a new time series module based data type, creates time series (TS.*) commands,
time series specific configurations and the TimeSeries ACL category.

* Module name: ts
* Data type name: `vktseries`
* Module shared object file name: ValkeyTimeSeries.so

With the Module name as "ts", ValkeyTimeSeries is compatible with RedisTimeseries in its Module name which is accessible by clients
through HELLO, MODULE LIST, and INFO commands. Also, metrics and configs will be prefixed with this name (by design for Modules).

Regarding the Module Data type name, because ValkeyTimeSeries's Module Data type (the current version) is not compatible with
RedisTimeSeries, it is not named same as RedisTimeSeries's. We are naming it "vktseries" and it is exactly 9 characters as enforced by
core Valkey logic for Module data types.
This will allow us to create a new Module Data Type in the future which can be compatible with the RedisTimeSeries and this will
be named the same as RedisTimeSeries's timeseries data type. When we do this, we will need to support both Data Types (current
version) and the future version and their names must be unique.

### Module Unload

Once the Module has been loaded, the `MODULE UNLOAD` will be rejected since Module Data type is created on load.
Valkey does not allow unloading of Modules that exports a module data type.

```
127.0.0.1:6379> MODULE UNLOAD timeseries
(error) ERR Error unloading module: the module exports one or more module-side data types, can't unload
```

### Persistence

ValkeyTimeSeries implements persistence related Module data type callbacks for the TimeSeries data type:

* rdb_save: Serializes timeseries objects to RDB.
* aux_save: Serializes the timeseries indexes
* rdb_load: Deserializes time series objects from RDB.
* aux_load: Deserializes the timeseries indexes from RDB
* aof_rewrite: Emits commands into the AOF during the AOF rewriting process.

### RDB Save and Load

During RDB Save of a time series object, the Module will save the number of filters, expansion rate, false positive rate.
And for every underlying time series in this object, .

In addition to the TimeSeries data proper, we also save the time series index dataobject's key, TTL, and serialized value of the bloom object

### RDB Compatibility with RedisTimeSeries

ValkeyTimeSeries is not RDB Compatible with RedisTimeSeries.

The metadata that gets written to the RDB is specific to the Module data type's structure and struct members.
Additionally, the data within the underlying time series is specific to the implementation of
the time series.

Because of this, it is not possible to be RDB compatible with RedisTimeSeries.

### AOF Rewrite handling

Module data types (including timeseries) can implement a callback function that will be triggered for TimeSeries objects to rewrite
its data as command/s. From the AOF callback, we will handle AOF rewrite by saving a TS.LOAD command with the key, TTL, and
serialized value of the corresponding bloom object.

### Migrating workloads from RedisTimeSeries:

Customers that currently use RedisTimeSeries can move to ValkeyTimeSeries using two approaches:

1. Create the time series objects to have the same properties using TS.CREATE / TS.ALTER on Valkey (with ValkeyTimeSeries loaded).
Re-populate the time series objects by inserting items by moving the existing samples to the Valkey server
(with ValkeyTimeSeries loaded). The workload can be moved without any errors since we are API Compatible.

Pros
* This is the simplest option in terms of effort - assuming the user is fine with recreating time series objects and adding
    items on the Valkey server (with ValkeyTimeSeries).

Cons
* The user will need to re-create the time series (using TS.CREATE/TS.ADD) and populate these objects **AFTER**
    switching to Valkey (with ValkeyTimeSeries).

2. Users can generate an AOF file from a server (that has the RedisTimeSeries module loaded) and with an on-going timeseries workload
that creates time series & inserts items into them. Next, this can be re-played on a Valkey Server (with ValkeyTimeSeries loaded).
Then, the user can move their existing workload to the Valkey server (with ValkeyTimeSeries loaded).

Pros
* TimeSeries objects can be created on the user's existing system (with Rebloom) and the user can also populate the objects
    by adding items (TS.ADD/TS.MADD) **BEFORE** switching to Valkey (with ValkeyTimeSeries).

Cons
* The user will need to manage AOF file generation on the server (with RedisTimeSeries) and ensure that the contents do not get
    re-written (e.g. as a result of BGREWRITEAOF) into a RDB file. This is because the RDB file with timeseries data
    generated by RedisTimeSeries is not compatible with ValkeyTimeSeries. The main drawback here is that the AOF can exceed a size
    limit and get truncated / re-written.

### Memory Management

On Module Load, the Rust Module overrides the memory allocator that delegates the allocation and deallocation tasks
to the Valkey server using the existing Module APIs: ValkeyModule_Alloc and ValkeyModule_Free. This API panics if unable
to allocate enough memory.

The timeseries data type also supports memory management related callbacks:

* free: Frees the time series object when it is deleted, expired or evicted.
* defrag: Supports active defrag for Bloom filter objects
* mem_usage: Reports bytes used by a Bloom object and is used by the MEMORY USAGE command
* copy: Supports a deep copy of time series objects and is used by the COPY command
* free_effort: Determine whether the bloom object's memory needs to be lazy reclaimed or synchronously freed. We return
    the number of filters in the bloom object as the free effort and this is similar to how the core handles free_effort
    for aggregated objects.

### Replication

Every TimeSeries based write operation (creation, adding and removing samples) will be replicated to replica nodes. Attempts 
of adding an already existing item to a bloom object (which returns 0) will not replicated.


## Specification

### TimeSeries Structure
Each time series object is represented by a sorted list of chunks, each containing a list of samples. Each sample is a tuple
of timestamp and a 64bit float value. 

A time series is identified by a series of label-value pairs used to retrieve the series in queries. Given that these
label values are used to group semantically similar time series, they are interned in a global dictionary to reduce
module memory.

The time series object also contains metadata like the retention policy, compaction policy, etc.

### TimeSeries Value Encoding
TimeSeries Chunks have configurable sample encoding strategies, defaulting to Gorilla XOR compression
Chunks can also be configured to store values as Uncompressed, but this is provided only for compatibility with RedisTimeseries.

### TimeSeries Indexing
In addition to labels, a time series is uniquely identified by an opaque 64bit unsigned int. Each label-value pair
is mapped to the id of each series which contains that attribute. The mapping is implemented as an [Adaptive Radix Tree (ART)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1f3m23b/blart_020_released_fastest_adaptive_radix_tree/), 
where each node is a 64bit [Roaring BitMap](https://roaringbitmap.org/about/).

The ART allows for efficient lookups and insertions, while the Roaring BitMap performs fast set operations on the series ids.
In addition,the ART supports path compression for quick prefix searches and memory savings based on our indexing scheme (see below).

### TimeSeries Indexing Scheme
The ART is used to index time series based on their labels. 
For each unique combination of label and value, we create a key by concatenating the label and value strings. e.g. "region=us-west".
This key is used to manage a 64bit roaring bitmap that contains the ids of all time series that have that label-value pair. To
retrieve ids for a given list of label-value pair, we look up the keys in the ART and perform an intersection.
We also maintain a mapping from id to valkey key to retrieve the time series after querying.


### RDB Format

During RDB save, the Module data type callback is invoked, and we satime series specific data.


### TimeSeries Command API

Currently following commands (from RedisTimeSeries) are not (currently) supported:

**`TS.CREATERULE`**

**`TS.DELETERULE`**

**`TS.INCRBY`**

**`TS.DECRBY`**

**`TS.REVRANGE`**

**`TS.MREVRANGE`**

These commands are scheduled for the second phase of development.

### Future Enhancements
Work is in progress to support PromQL as a query language, including transform, aggregation and rollup function support. A stretch goal is to support
alerts and notifications based on the query results.

### Configurations

The default properties for TimeSeries can be controlled using configs. The values of the
configs below are only used on a timeseries if the user does not specify the properties explicitly. Example: Using
TS.INSERT or TS.RESERVE can override the default properties.

Supported Module configurations:
1. Duplicate Policy
2. Default Chunk Size: Controls the default chunk memory capacity. When create operations (Ts.CREATE/TS.ADD/TS.INCRBY/TS.DECRBY) are used, the timeseries created
    will use the capacity specified by this config. 
3. ts.chunk_encoding: Controls the default expansion rate. When create operations (TS.ADD/MADD) are used, bloom
    objects created will use the expansion rate specified by this config. This controls the capacity of the new filter
    that gets added to the list of filters as a result of scaling.

### Constants
1. bloom_large_item_threshold: Memory usage of a timeseries beyond which timeseries are exempted from defrag operations
    and when deleted, the Module will indicate the object's free_effort as 0 to be async freed.
2. bloom_filter_max_memory_usage: The maximum memory usage of a particular time series that is allowed. Creation of
    time seriess larger than this will not be allowed.

### ACL

The ValkeyTimeSeries module will introduce a new ACL category - @ts.

There are 4 existing ACL categories which are updated to include new TimeSeries commands: @read, @write, @fast, @slow.

### Keyspace Event Notification

Every time series based write command (that involves mutation as explained in the section above) will be made to publish
a keyspace event after the data is mutated. Commands include: TS.CREATE, TS.ADD, TS.MADD.

* Event type: VALKEYMODULE_NOTIFY_GENERIC
* Event name: One of the two event names will be published based on the command & scenario:
 * bloom.add: Any TS.ADD, TS.MADD, or TS.INSERT command that results in adding item/s to a timeseries.
 * bloom.reserve: Any TS.ADD, TS.MADD, TS.INSERT, or TS.RESERVE command that results in creation of a timeseries.


Users can subscribe to the bloom events via the standard keyspace event pub/sub. For example,

```text
1. enable keyspace event notifications:
    valkey-cli config set notify-keyspace-events KEA
2. subsbcribe to keyspace & keyevent event channels:
    valkey-cli psubscribe '__key*__:*'
```

### Info metrics

Info metrics are visible through the `info bloom` or `info modules` command:
* Number of time series objects
* Total bytes used by time series objects

In addition to this, we have a specific API (`TS.INFO`) that can be used to list information and stats on the timeseries.
