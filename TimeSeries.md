# ValkeyTimeSeries Module RFC

## Abstract

The proposed feature is ValkeyTimeSeries which is a Rust based Module that brings a native time series data type to Valkey.

## Motivation
Support for a time series data type in Valkey is essential for developers who need to store and query time series data. 
Redis Ltd.â€˜s TimeSeries module is published under a proprietary license, hence cannot be distributed freely with ValKey.

We propose a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) based implementation to allows for better memory management, performance and safety.

## Design Considerations

The ValkeyTimeSeries module brings a time series module data type to Valkey and provides commands to create 
time series, operate on them (add sample, query, perform aggregations, compactions, downsampling and joins, etc).
It allows customization of properties of each series (compression, retention, compactions, etc) through commands and 
configurations. 

We aim to be efficient both in memory usage and performance. This is achieved through:
* use of parallelism and background tasks where appropriate (series compactions, index maintenance, etc)
* efficient memory management (interning for labels, index prefix compression, Roaring Bitmaps for series ids)
* efficient filtering and indexing

We have the following terminologies:
* TimeSeries Object: The top level structure representing the data type. It contains meta data and a list of lower-level
                chunks containing the actual sample data.
* Sample: A tuple of timestamp and value.
* Chunk: A container for samples. Chunks have configurable size and encoding policies.

### Enhancements over RedisTimeSeries
* Joins: ValkeyTimeSeries will support joins between time series objects, including INNER, OUTER and ASOF joins
* Filtering: support filtering using Prometheus style selectors
* Metadata: support for returning metadata on time series objects (label names, label values, cardinality, etc)
* Rounding: support for rounding sample values to a specified precision. This is enforced for all samples in a time series.
* Developer Ergonomics: support for relative timestamps in queries, e.g. `TS.RANGE key -6hrs -3hrs`, unit suffixes (e.g. `1s`, `3mb`, `20K`), 
    and a more expressive query language.

### Module OnLoad

Upon loading, the module registers a new time series module based data type, creates time series (TS.*) commands,
time series specific configurations and the TimeSeries ACL category.

* Module name: ts
* Data type name: `vktseries`
* Module shared object file name: ValkeyTimeSeries.so

With the Module name as "ts", ValkeyTimeSeries is compatible with RedisTimeseries in its Module name which is accessible by clients
through HELLO, MODULE LIST, and INFO commands. Also, metrics and configs will be prefixed with this name (by design for Modules).

Regarding the Module Data type name, because ValkeyTimeSeries's Module Data type (the current version) is not compatible with
RedisTimeSeries, it is not named same as RedisTimeSeries's. 

### Module Unload

Once the Module has been loaded, the `MODULE UNLOAD` will be rejected since Module Data type is created on load.
Valkey does not allow unloading of Modules that exports a module data type.

```
127.0.0.1:6379> MODULE UNLOAD timeseries
(error) ERR Error unloading module: the module exports one or more module-side data types, can't unload
```

### Persistence

ValkeyTimeSeries implements persistence related Module data type callbacks for the TimeSeries data type:

* rdb_save: Serializes timeseries objects to RDB.
* aux_save: Serializes the timeseries indexes
* rdb_load: Deserializes time series objects from RDB.
* aux_load: Deserializes the timeseries indexes from RDB
* aof_rewrite: Emits commands into the AOF during the AOF rewriting process.

### RDB Compatibility with RedisTimeSeries

ValkeyTimeSeries is not RDB Compatible with RedisTimeSeries.

The metadata that gets written to the RDB is specific to the Module data type's structure and struct members.
Additionally, the data within the underlying time series is specific to the implementation of
the time series.

Because of this, it is not possible to be RDB compatible with RedisTimeSeries.

### AOF Rewrite handling

Module data types (including timeseries) can implement a callback function that will be triggered for TimeSeries objects to rewrite
its data as command/s. From the AOF callback, we will handle AOF rewrite by saving a TS.LOAD command with the key, TTL, and
serialized value of the corresponding bloom object.

### Migrating workloads from RedisTimeSeries:

Customers that currently use RedisTimeSeries can move to ValkeyTimeSeries using two approaches:

1. Create the time series objects to have the same properties using TS.CREATE / TS.ALTER on Valkey (with ValkeyTimeSeries loaded).
Re-populate the time series objects by inserting items by moving the existing samples to the Valkey server
(with ValkeyTimeSeries loaded). The workload can be moved without any errors since we are API Compatible.

Pros
* This is the simplest option in terms of effort - assuming the user is fine with recreating time series objects and adding
    items on the Valkey server (with ValkeyTimeSeries).

Cons
* The user will need to re-create the time series (using TS.CREATE/TS.ADD) and populate these objects **AFTER**
    switching to Valkey (with ValkeyTimeSeries).

2. Users can generate an AOF file from a server (that has the RedisTimeSeries module loaded) and with an on-going timeseries workload
that creates time series & inserts items into them. Next, this can be re-played on a Valkey Server (with ValkeyTimeSeries loaded).
Then, the user can move their existing workload to the Valkey server (with ValkeyTimeSeries loaded).

### Memory Management

On Module Load, the Rust Module overrides the memory allocator that delegates the allocation and deallocation tasks
to the Valkey server using the existing Module APIs: ValkeyModule_Alloc and ValkeyModule_Free. This API panics if unable
to allocate enough memory.

The timeseries data type also supports memory management related callbacks:

* free: Frees the time series object when it is deleted, expired or evicted.
* defrag: Supports active defrag for Bloom filter objects
* mem_usage: Reports bytes used by a Bloom object and is used by the MEMORY USAGE command
* copy: Supports a deep copy of time series objects and is used by the COPY command
* free_effort: Determine whether the bloom object's memory needs to be lazy reclaimed or synchronously freed. We return
    the number of filters in the bloom object as the free effort and this is similar to how the core handles free_effort
    for aggregated objects.

### Replication
Every TimeSeries based write operation (creation, adding and removing samples) will be replicated to replica nodes.

## Specification

### TimeSeries Structure
Each time series object is represented by a sorted list of chunks, each containing a list of samples. Each sample is a tuple
of 64bit epoch based timestamp and a 64bit float value. 

A time series is optionally identified by a series of label-value pairs used to retrieve the series in queries. Given that these
label are used to group semantically similar time series, they are necessarily duplicated. We take advantage of this fact to 
intern label-value pairs, meaning that only a single allocation is made per unique pair, irrespective of the number of series
it occurs in.

The time series object also contains metadata like the retention policy, compaction policy, etc.

### TimeSeries Value Encoding
TimeSeries Chunks have configurable sample encoding strategies, defaulting to Gorilla XOR compression.
Chunks can also be configured to store values as Uncompressed, but this is provided only for compatibility with RedisTimeseries.

### TimeSeries Indexing
In addition to labels, a time series is uniquely identified by an opaque 64bit unsigned int. Each label-value pair
is mapped to the id of each series which contains that attribute. The mapping is implemented as an [Adaptive Radix Tree (ART)](https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/ART.pdf) (pdf), 
where each node is a 64bit [Roaring BitMap](https://roaringbitmap.org/about/).

The ART allows for efficient lookups and insertions, while the Roaring BitMap performs fast set operations on the series ids.
In addition, the ART supports path compression for and additional memory savings based on our indexing scheme (see below).

### TimeSeries Indexing Scheme
The ART is used to index time series based on their labels. For each unique combination of label and value, we create a key by concatenating 
the label and value strings. e.g. "region=us-west-2". This key is used to manage a 64bit roaring bitmap that contains the ids of all time series 
that have that label-value pair. To retrieve ids for a given list of label-value pair, we look up the keys in the ART and perform an intersection.
We also maintain a mapping from id to valkey key to retrieve the time series after querying.

### TimeSeries Filter Enhancements
We support an extension to the RedisTimeseries filter syntax to support regex based filtering using the operators `=~` and `!~`. 
For example:

* `TS.QUERYINDEX region=~us-west.*` will return all time series that have a label `region` with a value that starts with `us-west`.

* `TS.QUERYINDEX region!=~us-west.*` will return all time series that have a label `region` with a value that does not start with `us-west`.

In addition, we add Prometheus style selectors to the filter syntax (essentially an [Instant Vector](https://promlabs.com/blog/2020/07/02/selecting-data-in-promql/#instant-vector-selectors) selector). For example:

* `TS.QUERYINDEX latency{region=~"us-west-*",service="inference"}` will return all series recording latency for the inference service in all us west regions. 

* `TS.MRANGE 100 500 {service="inference"}` will return samples for the inference service across all series 

We also support `"OR"` matching for Prometheus style selectors. For example:

* `TS.QUERYINDEX latency{region="us-west" or region="us-east"}` will return all series recording latency samples in either `us-west` or `us-east` regions.

Note that for selectors of the form `metric{label="value"}`, `metric` is matched against the reserved `__name__` label. In other words,
the series is expected to have a label `__name__` with the value `metric`.

### RDB Format

During RDB save, the Module data type callback is invoked, and we satime series specific data.


### TimeSeries Command API

The following are supported TimeSeries commands with API syntax compatible with RedisTimeSeries:

**`TS.CREATE <key> ...`**

This API can be used to create a new time series object.

Currently following commands (from RedisTimeSeries) are not (currently) supported:

**`TS.CREATERULE`**

**`TS.DELETERULE`**

**`TS.INCRBY`**

**`TS.DECRBY`**

**`TS.REVRANGE`**

**`TS.MREVRANGE`**

These commands are scheduled for the second phase of development.

### Future Enhancements
Work is in progress to support PromQL as a query language, including transform, aggregation and rollup function support. A stretch goal is to support
alerts and notifications based on the query results.

We may support a tiered storage model where data is moved to a higher compression chunks (with higher access latency) after a certain period of time. 


### Configurations

The default properties for TimeSeries can be controlled using configs. The values of the
configs below are only used on a timeseries if the user does not specify the properties explicitly. Example: Using
TS.INSERT or TS.RESERVE can override the default properties.

Supported Module configurations:
1. Duplicate Policy
2. Default Chunk Size: Controls the default chunk memory capacity. When create operations (Ts.CREATE/TS.ADD/TS.INCRBY/TS.DECRBY) are used, the timeseries created
    will use the capacity specified by this config. 
3. ts.chunk_encoding: Controls the default expansion rate. When create operations (TS.ADD/MADD) are used, bloom
    objects created will use the expansion rate specified by this config. This controls the capacity of the new filter
    that gets added to the list of filters as a result of scaling.

### ACL

The ValkeyTimeSeries module will introduce a new ACL category - @ts.

There are 4 existing ACL categories which are updated to include new TimeSeries commands: @read, @write, @fast, @slow.

### Keyspace Event Notification

Every time series based write command (that involves mutation as explained in the section above) will be made to publish
a keyspace event after the data is mutated. Commands include: TS.CREATE, TS.ADD, TS.MADD.

* Event type: VALKEYMODULE_NOTIFY_GENERIC
* Event name: One of the two event names will be published based on the command & scenario:
 * ts.add
 * ts.create
 * ts.alter
 * ts.madd
 * ts.del
 


Users can subscribe to the bloom events via the standard keyspace event pub/sub. For example,

```text
1. enable keyspace event notifications:
    valkey-cli config set notify-keyspace-events KEA
2. subsbcribe to keyspace & keyevent event channels:
    valkey-cli psubscribe '__key*__:*'
```

### Info metrics

We have a specific API (`TS.INFO`) that can be used to list information and stats on the timeseries.
